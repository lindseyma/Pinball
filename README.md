Team name: Panma Canal
Project name : Pinball

Development Log
 
Project plan/outline:
Have a ball bounce in a rectangular space( with an opening at the bottom)
MVP: A very simple version working first (ball launch, four walls, flippers and a few basic bouncers)
Add different types of bouncers
Add other obstacles
Add a score system
Improve graphics

Things to do:
Create bounce interface
Ball launch and misc. physics related things
Create ball 
Create flippers
Score system

Later:
Graphics
Other Obstacles
  	

Daily log:

5/12/2016:
Lindsey Ma:Updated the read me file, planned how to start the project.
Katherine Pan: Planned how to start the project.

5/13/2016:
Lindsey Ma:Added the basic classes and setup function.

5/16/2016:
Lindsey Ma:displayed the ball.
Katherine Pan: Made a basic bouncing ball.

5/19/2016:
Lindsey Ma: Started writing the launch function for the ball.

5/20/2016:
Katherine Pan: started making circular bouncer.

5/23/2016:
Katherine Pan: added a rectangular pin table and more bouncers.

5/24/2016:
Lindsey Ma: Added flippers and a score system that increases when ball hits bouncers.

5/26/2016:
Lindsey Ma: Made the flippers move when keys "j" and "f" are pressed.

5/27/2016:
Katherine Pan: Adjusted bounce() so that the weight of the ball also affects it, instead of rectangular wall added separate class for parts of a wall.

5/29/2016:
Katherine Pan: Tried to approach launcher in a different way, not counting the milis() but how long the keys are pressed.

5/31/2016:
Lindsey Ma: worked on Curve edges of the wall.

6/1/2016:
Lindsey Ma:Worked on bouncing of straight edge of wall.
Katherine Pan: Made the launch function which launch the ball depending on how long the player press the space bar.

6/2/2016:
Lindsey Ma: encountered problems with merging code.

6/3/2016:
Lindsey Ma: Added more circle bouncers, and put together the different wall parts.
Katherine Pan:Instead of making flipper out of rectangles decided to make them out of lines

6/4/2016:
Katherine Pan: Flippers moves up when keys are pressed. Also added a limitation on launch Power.
Lindsey Ma: Worked on diagonal line collision.

6/5/2016:
Katherine Pan: Flipper collision detection works, the code also works for diagonal line collision detection.
Lindsey Ma: added the start screen, end screen and reset.

6/6/2016:
Katherine Pan: Decreases the ball's speed when bounced back. Added a moving platform that the ball bounce on.
Lindsey Ma:fixed the life and score display.
